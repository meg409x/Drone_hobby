import cv2

img= cv2.imread(r'C:\Users\MEGHA M NAIR\watch.jpg',cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
#As a replacement for IMREAD_COLOR/GRAYSCALE/UNCHANGED, the following number codes can be used-Color is 1, grayscale is 0, and the unchanged is -1. 
#Thus, for grayscale,one could do img = cv2.imread('watch.jpg', 0)
cv2.imshow('image', img)
#to show image
cv2.waitKey(0)
#to wait until any key is pressed
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
#to close all windows
